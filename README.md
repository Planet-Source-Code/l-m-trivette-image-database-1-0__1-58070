### Description

Organizes and saves images into a single access database. You can import/export single or multiple images at a time. Handles *.bmp, *.jpeg, *.jpg, *.wmf, *.ico, and *.gif image files. Great tool to keep and organize your image collections into one single access database. This is only a start. I do realize that more polishing and debugging need to be done. I hope someone just learn something from it.
 
### More Info
 
I wrote this in 1 day and still need to put in some database utilities to handle the upkeep of the database. ie - repair and compact database.
